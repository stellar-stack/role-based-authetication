How It Works

User Authentication

/login accepts username and password.
If valid, it generates a JWT token containing the user’s role.

Role-Based Access Control

@role_required([...]) checks if the user’s role (from JWT claims) is in the allowed list.
If not, returns 403 Forbidden.

Endpoints

/admin-data → Only admin can access.
/edit-data → admin and editor can access.
/view-data → All roles can access.

Example Usage
Bash# Login as admin
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/login \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'

# Use token to access admin route

curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin-data \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
